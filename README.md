This application's purpose is to add to dos, edit them and delete them when you're done.

The frontend of this application is developed with ReactJS technology and it consist of a few components. Main components are the registration, login and todos component that renders also done todos component and todo item component which are for displaying to dos.

I used NodeJS and MongoDB database to build the backend part of this application.
